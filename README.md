# -100Devs-githubdemo

This repo was created during a #100Devs VOD that aired a couple days before Christmas 2022. We learned basic git commands like how to create directories, files, open VS Code from git and how to commit files to github. In github, we learned how to create issues and pull requests as well as how to deploy a repo to the web for free hosting.
